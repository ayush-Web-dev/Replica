                    and how much philosophy I've learnt from design.</p> <br>
                <p class="info">For almost 3 years now, I have been studying philosophy at my own pace. Socrates is
                    usually called the milestone of modern philosophy. Before him, society concerned itself with
                    external dilemmas like is there a world above our world, why is a certain natural phenomenon
                    happening, etc.</p> <br>
                <p class="info">A very common phrase that was coined after him, and one that I believe many people know
                    already, is the Socratic method. What is it?</p> <br>
                <p class="info">Basically, a way to annoy the general joe. We all have seen those kids who just keep
                    asking questions. At first, it's cute, but after a while, it gets annoying because we don't have all
                    the answers. And god knows how much we hate not knowing. </p> <br>

            <div class="col-12">
                <p class="info">We know that most people don't want to face this big scary task, especially when it
                    doesn't give any tangible benefits. Completely understandable. However, if you are dabbling with UX
                    design, it is inevitable that you will find some very dangerous questions at some point in time. I
                    call them dangerous because I believe that just the right question can break the matrix. And we are
                    just humans.</p>
                <br> <br>
                <p class="info">One thing I want you to keep in mind while asking questions is that people are not as
                    self-aware as we'd like them to be. Many psychological principles come into play and someone would
                    not be aware of those unless they work in the field. These principles dictate our behavior, but
                    since that is how we've evolved, we don't notice it. The shiny object syndrome, position effect, and
                    Miller's law are some of the many. It is not their job to give you the right answers, it's your job
                    to get to the answer yourself.</p> <br> <br>
                <p class="info">According to my notes, an effective research question should:</p> <br> <br>
                <ul class="info">
                    <li>Be interesting (because you gotta have fun at your job) </li>
                    <li>Ask something important</li>
                    <li> Be focussed and specific</li>
                    <li> Lead to a testable hypothesis </li>
                    <li> Help go beyond the obvious </li>
                    <li> Allow you to make predictions on measurable data </li>
                </ul> <br> <br>
                <p class="info">For me, writing 30 questions around the problem statement usually works. I have written
                    questions that were outright stupid, and I'm not even ashamed of that. For instance, when I was
                    working on a meditation app, one of the questions was something on the lines of “How might we make
                    something that isn't cringey?” and believe it or not, it actually helped. While doing user research
                    I found out some people find meditation rather “out of reach” and “fake and pretentious”, which gave
                    validation to not just my hypothesis, but also to me. Since then “no questions are stupid” is my
                    motto, much to the dismay of my friends and family. </p>
